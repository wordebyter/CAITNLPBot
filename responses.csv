What does it mean to mix 2 cups of sparkling water with every 3 cups of apple juice?,"It means for every 3 cups of apple juice used, you need to add 2 cups of sparkling water to create the mixture. It's a ratio of sparkling water to apple juice.",-0.2
How do I find out how much sparkling water is needed for 15 cups of apple juice?,"You can use the ratio of sparkling water to apple juice to calculate this. Since 2 cups of sparkling water are mixed with 3 cups of apple juice, you can set up a proportion to find out how much sparkling water is needed for 15 cups of apple juice.",-0.2
Can you give me a hint on how to set up the proportion?,"Sure! If 2 cups of sparkling water go with 3 cups of apple juice, you can write it as 2/3. Now, if you have 15 cups of apple juice, you can set up the proportion as 2/3 = x/15, where x is the amount of sparkling water needed.",-0.3
What do I do after setting up the proportion?,"After setting up the proportion, you solve for x. This involves cross-multiplying and then dividing to find the value of x, which represents the cups of sparkling water needed.",-0.1
I'm not sure how to cross-multiply. Can you explain?,"Of course! Cross-multiplying means you multiply the numerator of one fraction by the denominator of the other fraction and do the same for the other pair. So, you'll multiply 2 by 15 and 3 by x, then set those two products equal to each other.",-0.4
What's the next step after cross-multiplying?,"After cross-multiplying, you'll have an equation you can solve for x. You'll divide both sides of the equation by the number next to x to isolate x on one side. This will give you the amount of sparkling water needed.",-0.3
Can you help me understand why we use ratios for this problem?,"Ratios are used to compare two quantities. In this problem, the ratio helps us understand the relationship between the amount of sparkling water and apple juice needed for the mixture. It ensures the mixture has the correct proportions for the desired taste.",-0.1
What if I get a fraction as an answer?,"If you get a fraction as an answer, that's okay! It means that the exact amount of sparkling water needed is not a whole number. You can either leave it as a fraction or convert it to a decimal, depending on what's asked for.",-0.4
Is there a simpler way to solve this problem without setting up a proportion?,"Another way to think about it is to see how many times the ratio fits into the amount of apple juice you have. Since 3 cups of apple juice require 2 cups of sparkling water, you can divide the total amount of apple juice by 3 and then multiply by 2 to find the amount of sparkling water needed.",-0.25
What if I still don't understand after trying?,It's okay to find some problems challenging. I recommend reviewing the steps slowly and trying to solve similar problems to practice. You can also ask for further clarification or examples to help understand the concept better.,-0.1
